            <p>"You always bump into someone you know here," Daniela Baggio Morano exclaims, waving to a passer-by.
                She's walking me from Kōenji train station into a kaleidoscopic flurry of vintage clothes shops, secret
                vinyl stores and lantern-lit laneways wafting with smells from early evening izakayas (pubs).
                It's Saturday afternoon, daylight is dipping and neon signs are sparking to life, cooking up a weird,
                electro-sunset that makes everyone look like the cocktail party version of themselves. Passing beneath a
                bridge. Daniela keeps spotting people she knows. It's the last thing I expected in Tokyo — a sprawling
                super-city that's home to 37 million souls. </p>

                hypermodern virtual-reality show is a rite of passage — as a multitude of international visitors will
                discover during the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Summer Olympics. It's like playing an Xbox version of
                a city break. </p>

            <p>I had my Bill Murray moments, too. I got stuck in a cat cafe, trying to back out of a tiny room full of
                vending machines without tripping over a rare breed of kitty. I marvelled at tourists in superhero suits
                taking selfies on go-kart tours, and contrasted the souped-up, neon-splattered cityscapes of Shinjuku
                and Ginza with the manicured city parks and polite-but-firm signs requesting commuters not to talk on
                their phones on the subway.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="ramen">
            <p>
                Ramen's the great leveller, a bowl of soul that unites everyone for a couple of hundred yen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was talked through ramen's origins as a 'new' food whose popularity was aided by cheap imports of
                American flour after the Second World War; a dish with its origin in Chinese-style wheat noodles, but
                which the Japanese made their own with mind-bendingly good, umami-rich broths. It's Japan's pasta — a
                comfort food that amounts to way more than the sum of its parts, and whose shops tie neighbourhoods and
                people together.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You don't sit and chat with ramen," they say . "You go in, stop talking when your order comes, eat and
                go. Ramen nerds say that it takes just eight minutes for the noodles to go bad."
            </p>
            <p>
                A couple of hours later, I'm standing outside a ramen-ya called Kikanbo, near Kanda Station, punching my
                order into a vending machine. Inside, the room is black, the stereo plays a taiko drumbeat, and three
                chefs are busy at work.

                I shoot for a spice rating of three on both kara and shibi, and it takes just a couple of minutes for
                the bowl to arrive. Its broth is miso-magical, the noodles have bite, and slices of roast pork pull
                apart with a tug of the chopsticks. I watch the clock, but soon run over the eight minutes; not that
                anyone notices. All the customers are united in a Y800 (£5.45) slurpfest.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 50px; ">
                <i style="background: linear-gradient(rgba(246, 246, 246, 0.1),rgba(246, 246, 246, 0.1));">
                    Tokyo can be a dizzying, disorientating city. "Even though I live here I feel like a traveller," one
                    local tells me. As I chew and chat my way through several neighbourhoods, however, I find a fleeting
                    sense of equilibrium.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 50px;">
                I join shoals of salarymen gobbling yakitori (skewered chicken) under the railway arches of Yūrakuchō. I
                take a tour of Tsukiji Fish Market with sushi chefs from The Prince Park Tower Hotel, where we slip
                through the melee of forklifts, seafood fridges and styrofoam crates to watch an expert slice and dice a
                167kg scarlet-fleshed tuna. "It's pretty much the same as cutting a diamond," smiles the knifeman,
                Nobuhito Okado, wiping his blade clean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Afterwards, we stop by the tiny Yamato Sushi where chefs pluck out different cuts of tuna, squid, eel
                and sea urchin to place on small boards in front of us. It's chaos outside. Carts are honking, tourists
                elbowing and the glass towers of Shibuya pumping out their neon razzle-dazzle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside, however, there's a moment of zen. It's not quite like bumping into someone I know. But the
                chef's rolling of sushi rice between his thumb and palm triggers a recognition. He's doing what Yuko
                said he should, and for a split second, I feel connected to some kind of invisible current.
            </p>
